/// Moves a timeline pinned to its newest message with the composer as the
/// keyboard shows and hides, instead of on a clock of its own.
///
/// The composer follows the keyboard's spring, but the timeline's offset
/// doesn't:
/// - Hiding, SwiftUI animates the keyboard safe area frame by frame on a
///   slower curve, so the timeline trails the composer by up to ~170pt and is
///   still falling after the composer has settled. (When an interactive
///   dismissal stalls the main thread, the safe area instead collapses in one
///   step and UIKit animates the correction with a late 0.18s `bounds.origin`
///   animation.)
/// - Showing, the safe area grows in one step and the timeline only moves
///   when `ScrollOnComposerFocus` scrolls to the newest message on an
///   ease-out curve, so the composer first runs ahead of the timeline and
///   then covers it.
///
/// Both the composer and the timeline's offset are set on the main thread
/// before each Core Animation commit. Just before the commit, this draws the
/// timeline at the offset that matches the composer's progress, with a held
/// additive `bounds.origin` offset over whatever SwiftUI set. The scroll view's
/// real offset is left to SwiftUI, so scrolling state and hit testing are
/// unchanged once the move ends.
///
/// The composer sits a fixed distance above the safe area's edge, so it
/// travels exactly as far as the safe area changes. That ties the two together
/// without knowing the keyboard's height.
